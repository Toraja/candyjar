== Init project
Like many other package managers, `luarocks` requires some fixture to start up. +
`luarocks` has a convenient command to prepare that and simply run `luarocks init`.

== Install rocks

=== Install project dependencies
In case you start working on an existent project, you need to download all the
project's dependencies. +
To do so, run `luarocks install --deps-only <rockspec file>`.

== Troubleshoot

Installed rocks are not found::
If lua and luarocks are not installed in the default location (i.e.
`/usr/local`), lua cannot find installed rocks. +
Run below commands to so that lua/luarocks can recognise the rocks. +
+
[source,shell]
----
eval "$(luarocks path --bin)"
