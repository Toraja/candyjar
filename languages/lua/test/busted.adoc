= Busted

== Test files
`busted` commands looks for files matching `*_spec.lua` under `spec`
directory and runs tests in them. +
Pass file name to run tests only in that file, as in `busted <test dir/file>...`.

== Writing tests

=== require
Use the relative path from the test file because:
* Proper import path (e.g. `util.string`) will not be available unless the
  library has been built using `luarocks make`, and it is very cumbersome run
  the command whenever source code is modified.
* That proper import path is also treated as if it is relative path (e.g. `./util/string.lua`), 
  but it is unlikely for libraries as the first segment is usually the root
  directory of the library and you would not run test from outside the root.
