=== Update modules
To update required module in `go.mod` to the specific commit hash, simply
replace the version (or pseudo-version) to the desired commit hash, then run
`go mod tidy`. +
This rewrites the commit hash to appropriate pseudo-version. +
You can also specify branch (such as `main` and `feature/awesome`) as long as it
exists on remote.
