== Run ad hoc command on remote hosts
Setup to bypass all the user prompts (confirmation, password and etc.) as they cause ansible commands to fail
when ansible targets multiple hosts.

.Add the below to your sshconfig
[source]
----
Host *
  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
  IdentityFile <your private ssh key>
----

If you want to be more precise, put global IP address of each remote host instead of `*`.
(ansible accesses remote hosts via IP address)

This can also be done using `ansible.cfg`
[source]
----
[ssh_connection]
ssh_args = -i <your private ssh key> -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
----

.Setup ssh-agent
[source,sh]
----
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
ssh-add <your private ssh key>
----

.Run shell commands on each remote hosts
[source,sh]
----
# e.g. Running hostname command on the specified host(s) in the inventory
ansible -i <inventory> -m shell -a hostname <host>...
----
