= Renovate

== Config

=== depName

==== Go
Usually module name, which is used as `depName` is present at the top of `go.mod` file of the package. +
To monitor specific binary (or something) of the package instead of the package itself, append the `tag` for that release without version part. +
.e.g. atlas CLI (deprecated)
----
# renovate: datasource=go depName=ariga.io/atlas/cmd/atlas versioning=semver
----
Here, `ariga.io/atlas` is the module name, and `cmd/atlas` is the tag without version.

== Tips
Run Renovate locally::
+
[source,shell]
----
docker run --interactive --tty --rm --volume ./:/usr/src/app renovate/renovate:latest --platform=local --dry-run=full
----
Packages/Dependencies that are not up to date are logged as `WARN`.
