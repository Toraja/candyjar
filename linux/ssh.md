# SSH

## Client

### Connect without password prompt
1. Create a pair of RSA keys on the local machine. (`ssh-keygen`)
1. Store the private key in somewhere secure on the local machine.
1. Add the content of the public key to the file `~/.ssh/authorized_key` of the user
on the remote machine you want to connect to,
or simply issue `ssh-copy-id <user>@<host>` command.
1. Add the code below to bashrc etc. of the local machine  
`eval $(keychain --agents ssh --eval <path-to-key>)`  
where *pass-to-key* is the absolute path or the relative path from `~/.ssh` to the private key on
the local machine.  
1. SSH to the server.

If keychain outputs warning message like below, update keychain as it is old and does not support
OpenSSH 6.8+ format.  
`Can't determine fingerprint from the following line, falling back to filename`

### Options 
Add as option with `-o` or edit `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`.

#### Connect without storing finger print  
`StrictHostKeyChecking=no`

#### Not storing host key to known_hosts file
`UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null`

## Server (daemon)

### Setup

#### Install
```sh
## alpine linux
apk update
apk --no-cache add openssh augeas
```
`augeas` is for `augtool` which is to edit config file with ease.

#### Congifuration

##### Hostkeys
Hostkey is required to start sshd.  
(Hostkey will be stored in `known_hosts` on client side when a client accesses).  
To create one, run the following command as it exactly is.  
```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key -N ''
```
Password for the key must be empty or sshd complains as below:
```
sshd: no hostkeys available -- exiting.
```

##### sshd_config
By default, logging in as non-root user is possible (either with key or password).  
Logging in as root with key is allowed but not with password. To enable it, change  
`PermitRootLogin` to `yes`.  
Although login as root with key is allowed (if `PubkeyAuthentication` is `yes`),  
client's public key must be passed to the server somehow without using `ssh-copy-id`  
or `sftp` as those requires password authentication.  

Use `augtool` to add or change option.  
```sh
augtool set /files/etc/ssh/sshd_config/PasswordAuthentication no
```
(Un)commenting is not supported, so even if commented option with the same name exists,
it is ignored and new line is added to the bottom.

**PermitRootLogin**  
Default: _prohibit-password_  
Must be yes to login as root with password.  
Logging in with password when this is `prohibit-password` result in `Permission denied, please try again.`

**PasswordAuthentication**  
Default: _yes_  
Enable login with password.  

**PubkeyAuthentication**  
Default: _yes_  
Setting this to `yes` allows logging in with key.  
If a client accesses using key when this is set to `no`, the client will be prompted to  
enter password.

**AuthorizedKeysFile**  
Add clients' public key to any file specified here.  
Centralised location such as `/etc/ssh/authorized_keys/%u` (`%u` means login user name).

#### ssh login user
Add a user and group for the user.  
User added by `adduser --disabled-password` will be locked so you need to unlock it  
by running `password -u ${user}`.  
Or, add a user with `useradd` command with option `-p '*'`.  
In this way, the user will not be locked.  
System user cannot be logged in, so do not add `--system` option.

#### authorized_keys
Add clients' public key to one of files specified at `AuthorizedKeysFile` in `sshd_config`.  
The contents of authorized_keys is simply copies of clients public key.

## Port Forwarding
- `AllowTcpForwarding` in `sshd_config` must be set to `yes`.
- The client has to have private key of both jump server and destination server  
  if you are using key authentication.
- Add option `-J <user>@<jump host>` to command or the snippet below to `.ssh/config` in order to  
  access to destination without manually accessing to jump server.
  ```
  Host <destination host>
    ProxyJump <jump server host>
  ```

## X11 Forwarding

### Setup

#### Client

##### Packages
- xauth

##### SSH Configuration
**ssh_config**  
- ForwardX11 yes  
  (or add `-X` option to ssh command)

##### Others
- `DISPLAY` environment variable is set

#### Server

##### Packages
- xauth
- any GUI app (e.g. `xeyes`)

##### SSH Configuration
**sshd_config**  
- X11Forwarding yes
- X11UseLocalhost no

### Via jump server
- Origin and destination server must be set up as illustrated above.
- Connect to destination server via jump server with port forwarding.
- `X11Forwarding` does not have to be enabled on jump server.
