[NOTE]
====
LTS to LTS upgrade is not available until the first point release. +
Refer to the link:https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases[release schedule] for when it becomes available
====

[CAUTION]
====
During the upgrade, you might be prompted to keep the current config files or
replace them with new ones. +
A good rule of thumb is to always keep the current config, while noting the
difference. Then apply the difference when the upgrade is all done. +
Otherwise you might end up feeling miserable because you cannot login the
server (or because of some other things).
