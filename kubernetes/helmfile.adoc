= Helmfile

== Troubleshoot

Config not found::
As with other kubernetes related tools, `helmfile` reads `KUBECONFIG` environment variable.
If `KUBECONFIG` is relative path, and helmfile is run with `-f/--file` option,
`helmfile` will look for kubeconfig file relative to the path specified in the option.
