== `instance` and `\\__address__` labels

\\__address__::
What a scraper actually connects to.

instance::
It will be set to the value of `\\__address__` if no `instance` label is
present after service discovery and relabelling. +
So changing this does not affect what a scraper actually scrapes.

If target address contains parameters that you do not want to store in the
storage (e.g. security reason), relabel `instance` label instead of
`\\__address__` label, because meta labels (which begins and ends with `__`)
are discarded before ingested into storage. +

.Example
[source,yaml]
----
relabel_configs:
 - source_labels: [__address__]
   regex:  '^(.*)\?.*'           # Remove everything after `?` (i.e. remove all the parameters)
   replacement: '${1}'           # URL without any parameter will be assigned to `instance` label
   target_label: instance
