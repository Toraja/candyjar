= blackbox exporter

== Debugging
Login to any server that can access to blackbox exporter, and query blackbox exporter with `debug=true` parameter. +
The URL of blackbox exporter should be somewhere in you helmfile (or some config loaded by helmfile).

NOTE: Adding `debug: true` to `scrape_configs.params` adds the parameter to query from vmagent to blackbox exporter. +
But since vmagent expects the response from blackbox exporter as json but `debug` response includes non-json text, vmagent logs error messages and cannot see the debug contents.
