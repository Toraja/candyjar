== Tips
Pass stringified JSON as variable::
With JSON body, it stringified JSON gets escaped excessively and extra backslashes are added. +
link:https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#multiline-string-body[multiline string body] must be used to avoid that.

Stringified JSON pass via --secret not concealed in the verbose output::
Usually the value is not present in the variable list and concealed in the parameter of curl command (replaced with `***`). +
However, stringified JSON is printed normally in the curl parameter (maybe too complecated to conceal?)

Difference between --variable and --secret::
`--variable` strips double quotations in the given value while `--secret` preserves them. +
So with `--secret`, the variables inside JSON payload must not be quoted if the value is already quoted.
